# VisualQueue

Cloud development project was for school during Fall 2020 semester, inspired off of my own experiences being a TA for a different CS class and hosting office hours over Zoom for a high volume of students.

Designed with Anuglar front-end, NodeJS web server, and data storage with MongoDB

# Description

- Web application made in response to the Covid-19 outbreak using Angular, Node.js, and MongoDB
- Communicates to back-end using REST API and Node.js web server
- Organizes classes and recognizes enrolled students, professor, and teaching assistants with MongoDB
- Identified and addressed issue of using a spreadsheet to manually maintain students using office hours
- Students can visually see a queue and their position in line while in a Zoom waiting room
- TAs and professors can open/close their virtual offices, admit students, and send messages to those waiting in line.
